## Key Concepts

### Design Variables

The stirred tank reactor model considers four key design factors:

1. **Baffle Thickness** (10-50 mm)
2. **Baffle Length** (50-200 mm)
3. **Blade Chord** (75-110 mm)
4. **Impeller RPM** (25-150 rpm)

### Response Variables 

The simulations and experiments typically measure:

- Mixing time (CFD Analysis)
- Power consumption (CFD Analysis)
- Safety factor (FEA Analysis)
- Flow patterns (CFD Analysis)
- Velocity distributions (CFD Analysis)

### CFD Simulation Data

The CFD data is stored in `Python/` and `MATLAB/`directory:

- Mixing_tank_single_response.xlsx (Contains all Predictors and the first Response e.g. "Average-k")
- Mixing_tank_multiple_responses.xlsx (Contains all Predictors and all Responses)

## Model Description

The model describes the numerical simulation and design optimisation of hydrodynamics and mixing processes in a Stirred Tank Reactor (STR). It captures the complex relationship between:

- Reactor geometry (baffle thickness, baffle length, blade chord) and mixing performance
- Impeller speed and flow characteristics (flow patterns, velocity distributions)
- Design variables and response variables (average k, power consumption, safety factor, mixing time)
- Multi-objective trade-offs between competing performance criteria

### Key Features

1. **Design of Experiments** — Central Composite Design (CCD) generated with ANSYS DesignXplorer for systematic exploration of the design space
2. **Statistical Analysis** — ANOVA and mean/interaction effect analysis to identify significant factors
3. **Response Surface Methodology** — 3D surface and 2D contour plots for visualising factor–response relationships
4. **Multi-Objective Optimisation** — MOGA with polynomial and kriging surrogate models for Pareto-optimal designs
5. **Cross-platform** — Equivalent implementations in both Python and MATLAB

## Workflow

1. **Design Phase** — Load the CCD DoE table using `Load_and_display_DoE_table`
2. **Effect Analysis** — Run `Compute_mean_effects_and_interactions` to compute mean and interaction effects and perform ANOVA
3. **Response Surface Analysis** — Run `Response_surface_and_contour_plots` to create 3D surface and 2D contour plots for significant interactions
4. **Optimisation** — Run `MOGA_optimisation_with_polynomial` or `MOGA_optimisation_with_kriging` to find Pareto-optimal operating parameters

## Input Data Format

The scripts expect CFD simulation data as Excel files:
- `Mixing_tank_single_response.xlsx` — Contains all predictors and the first response (e.g. "Average-k")
- `Mixing_tank_multiple_responses.xlsx` — Contains all predictors and all responses

Data files should be placed in the appropriate `Python/` or `MATLAB/` directory.

## Output

The scripts provide:
- DoE table display with all factors and responses
- Bar charts of mean and interaction effects for each response
- ANOVA results identifying statistically significant terms
- 3D response surface and 2D contour plots for the most significant factor interactions
- Pareto-optimal solutions from multi-objective optimisation

## Notes

- The Python and MATLAB scripts include commented sections for additional guidance.
- Adjust file paths in scripts if necessary to match your directory structure.
- For CFD simulations, you will need access to ANSYS Fluent or similar CFD software.
- The `Jupyter_notebook.pdf` and `MATLAB_Livescript.pdf` provide pre-executed outputs and can be used for reference without running any code.

## Advanced Usage

For sensitivity analysis or uncertainty quantification:
1. Vary the CCD factor ranges and re-run the DOE to assess the robustness of optimal designs
2. Perform leave-one-out cross-validation on the polynomial and kriging surrogate models to evaluate prediction accuracy
3. Conduct a Monte Carlo analysis on the Pareto-optimal solutions to quantify the effect of input uncertainties on the responses
4. Compare polynomial and kriging surrogate model predictions to identify the most reliable metamodel for each response
5. Validate the optimised design points against independent CFD simulations or experimental measurements
